# EX-NO-7-Implement-DES-Encryption

## Aim:

To use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm for a practical application, such as securing sensitive data transmission in financial transactions.
.
## ALGORITHM:

1. DES is based on a symmetric key encryption technique that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks.
2. DES uses a Feistel network structure with 16 rounds of processing for encryption.
3. DES has a 64-bit key, but only 56 bits are used for encryption (the remaining 8 bits are for parity).
4. DES applies initial and final permutations along with 16 rounds of substitution and permutation transformations to produce ciphertext.
